# Project 4 - Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Prediction 
- Predicting the probability of patients having CVD in the future by using Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF) with a focus to maximize recall by at least 95%.
- Contributed to EDA, data pre-processing, modelling & evaluation
- The combination RF & random over-sampling method achieved the best scores for all evaluation metrics with a precision of 86.9%, recall of 97.3%, & AUC of 94.9%.
